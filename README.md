# TASK BUILD A RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM USING COLLABORATIVE FILTERING OR MATRIX FACTORIZATIONTECHNIQUES.

#A **Recommendation System** in machine learning is a tool designed to predict user preferences and suggest items they are likely to enjoy based on past interactions or behavior. It is widely applied across industries like e-commerce, entertainment, education, healthcare, and social media. For instance, e-commerce platforms use it to recommend products based on purchase history, while streaming services suggest movies or songs tailored to user tastes. To create a recommendation system, data is first collected, such as user-item interactions or ratings, and preprocessed by cleaning, encoding, and handling missing values. Based on the data, techniques like **Collaborative Filtering** or **Matrix Factorization** are implemented. Collaborative Filtering uses user-user or item-item similarity to generate suggestions, while Matrix Factorization methods like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) reduce the user-item matrix into latent features for better predictions. The model is trained on this data to predict user preferences, and its performance is evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, or Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Finally, it is deployed into an application for real-world use, providing personalized recommendations to users in real-time. Libraries like Pythonâ€™s **Surprise**, **scikit-learn**, or **TensorFlow** simplify building such systems, making them a powerful way to enhance user engagement and satisfaction.
